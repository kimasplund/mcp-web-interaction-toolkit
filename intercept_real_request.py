MANUAL BROWSER INTERCEPTION GUIDE
==================================

To see what ClickBank actually sends, do this in Chrome:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Clear network log
4. Navigate to: https://accounts.clickbank.com/login.htm
5. Enter credentials but DON'T submit yet
6. In Network tab, check "Preserve log"
7. Submit the form
8. Look for the POST request (probably to /api/login or similar)
9. Right-click the request → Copy → Copy as cURL

The cURL command will show:
- Exact endpoint
- All headers
- Exact parameter names and values
- Any transformations done to the data

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
-----------------
1. Is the password hashed/encoded?
2. Are there additional hidden parameters?
3. What exact headers are sent?
4. Is there a different endpoint?
5. Are credentials sent as JSON or form-encoded?

Based on what we know:
- Endpoint: /api/login (confirmed)
- Method: POST (confirmed)
- Gets JSESSIONID (confirmed)
- Returns error (need to fix)

The error suggests:
- Wrong parameter names
- Missing required parameters
- Credentials need transformation
- Or it's checking browser fingerprinting

HYPOTHESIS:
-----------
ClickBank's Next.js app likely:
1. Adds a timestamp parameter
2. May hash/encode the password
3. Adds browser fingerprint data
4. Or uses a completely different API endpoint for the actual authentication

Since this is a Next.js app, check if credentials go to:
- /_next/auth/callback/credentials
- /api/auth/callback/credentials
- Or a GraphQL endpoint

The fact we get JSESSIONID means we're hitting the right backend,
but the parameters or format is wrong.
